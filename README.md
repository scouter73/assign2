For this assignment I'd like you to add some CSS to the provided HTML file. You must write your CSS in an external stylehseet and link to it in the HTML. Below you'll find a list of some of the things I'd like you to do.

Make the nav bar look more like a nav bar
Change the background color
Remove the bullets from the list (check out the list-style-type property)
Remove the underlines from the links (check out the text-decoration property)
Make the links line up next to each other
Seperate the h2 in the header from the links
Change the color of the links inside of the main document
Display the cards (div elements) in a 2x2 grid
Style the cards a little bit (border, background color, etc)
Similar to the header, seperate the list and paragraph in the footer
I'd also like you to do the following for mobile styling. The exact breakpoints aren't important, just play around with it until you notice things getting cramped

Make the cards show up in one column
Make the footer one column. The list should be below the paragraph (there are more flex directions than column and row, those might be useful here)
In the images folder I've given you a couple examples of what my page looks like. Your's doesn't need to be exactly like mine, I just wanted to give you a general idea of what layout I was going for.
